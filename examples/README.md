	cd examples
	highlight-code test.xhtml

This should produce 2 files:

  * test.xhtml.highlighted.xhtml - the markup has been processed and your code and pre tags have been replaced by divs with styling
  * coderay.css - the basic CSS needed to render the highlighting

You should be able to view test.xhtml.highlighted.xhtml in a browser.
